# Product Requirements Document: MCP Server for Twenty CRM
## AI Companion for Intelligent CRM Management

---

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for Twenty CRM transforms how users interact with their customer relationship management system by providing an AI companion that seamlessly integrates with any LLM-powered application. Rather than treating AI as a separate tool, this server enables natural, conversational interactions that provide advanced insights, automate workflows, and support data-driven decision making.

The server leverages Twenty's existing API infrastructure (both GraphQL and REST) and authentication system while providing real-time, schema-aware access that adapts to custom field configurations and data models. This creates a foundation for AI applications to become intelligent CRM companions rather than simple automation tools.
